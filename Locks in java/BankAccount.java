TRY LOCK
Lock() : Acquires the lock, blocking the thread until it's available,
TryLock():Attempts to acquire the lock without waiting, returning true if successful and false if the lock is already held.
TryLock(time):Waits up to the specified time to acquire the lock, returning false if it's still unavailable after the timeout.
Unlock():Releases the lock so other threads can acquire it â€” must be called in a finally block to avoid deadlocks.
